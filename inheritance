# SINGLE LEVEL INHERITANCE EXMAPLE

# Multi level inheritance example

#Multiple Inheritance Example
class a: # class a have only own your method
    def father(self):
        print("my fahter name is pankajbhai")
class b : # class b have only own your method
    # here class a and b not inherite to each other
    def mother(self):
        print("my mother name is vanitabeen")
class c:
    def x(self):
        print("class c")
class d(a,b,c): # here class c have both class method
    def my(self):
        print("my name is rupesh")
